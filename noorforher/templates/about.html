        <h1>Hey, I’m Hafsa</h1>
        <p>
            I’m a Mindset & Confidence Coach for women who want emotional peace, 
            clarity, and inner strength. But before I ever became a coach,
            I was the child and even when became a woman struggling silently with anxiety.<br><br>

            I know what it feels like to wake up with a heavy heart…<br>
            To overthink every decision…<br>
            To feel like my mind was running faster than I could breathe…<br>
            To smile on the outside while feeling overwhelmed on the inside.<br><br>

            There were days when even simple things — a conversation, a message, a task — 
            felt like too much. And I kept thinking:<br><br>

            “Why can’t I just be normal?”<br><br>

            But the truth was…<br>
            I wasn’t broken.<br>
            I was overwhelmed, unheard, and emotionally tired.<br>
            And that realization changed everything.
